# Computational Intelligence 
This repository showcases my implementation of assignments and projects from the Computational Intelligence course. 
The course focuses on optimization algorithms for solving learning problems, including evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. 
It explores topics like non-differentiable objective functions, and the use of evolutionary algorithms in training neural networks. 
The repository demonstrates the application of these methods to various AI and computer science problems.
